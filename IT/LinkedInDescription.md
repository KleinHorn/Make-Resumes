# Linkedin Description - IT

Ever since I built my first desktop computer with my father when I was 10 years old, I have been hooked on technology. Nothing satisfies me more than pulling apart a technological or mechanical trinket to figure out how it works. To my father’s dismay, many times this meant the TV remote was in pieces (although I always made sure to put it back together). Soon after building my first computer, I read my first programming book: John Zelle’s Python Programming. This only heightened my interest in tech and kicked off my learning journey.

I love puzzling over coding challenges, spending time troubleshooting node module dependencies, and figuring out why my home network is so slow. Problem-solving is my favorite activity and I am often called upon to solve technical problems for both my family and friends. I was often that kid in class that the teacher asked to fix the projector or figure out why the audio system is not working.

I love solving problems, what problems can I solve for you?
